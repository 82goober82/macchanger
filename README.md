# macchanger
# click on CLICKME.sh and it downloads macchanger then changes it's own name and finally spoofes your mac address, you just need to give it exacutable permisions.

# macchanger-bash-script
# before I say anything to run CLICKME.sh you must run the command, chmod +x CLICKME.sh
# you may display all the conntents of CLICKME.sh, the file changes it's name then spoofs your mac address,
# I have made a guid on how to make it spoof automaticly and the first thing you do is download wicd, 
# Please give me feadback on how this script worked and anything I can improve or fix, (Bugs, error messages ect.)
# I hope you like the script and that you will have a codefull day ;)
